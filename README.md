# MarkDown-Editor
My first ever fully fledged working desktop application written in Golang using the fyne.io library. This can be used to read and write .md files.

How to install and run this in your pc:

1. You should have Golang installed in your system, if you dont then please visit this link to download and install it: https://go.dev/doc/install
   

2. After installing go, get the files here and put them in a folder, name it whatever you want.

4. Now, open your cmd and go to the directory where those files are stored. 
   

5. Next you have to install fyne into your system, follow this to install it https://developer.fyne.io/started/
6. Finally, once all those things are done, type go run main.go and there you will have it. (It might take some time the first time you are doing it)

Incase, you want to use the icon.png file and create an executable for your computer, follow these:

1. Assuming, that you have fyne installed.
2. Type in your command prompt/terminal "fyne package -os windows -icon icon.png -name Markdown", without quotes
3.You will have your executable ready.

Some important instructions:
1. Type # to start a heading
